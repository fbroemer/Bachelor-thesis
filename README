This repository should be a pattern for your Bachelor / Master thesis. 
It supports 
- Creating your own Cover page easily
- Table of contents
- Table of figures
- List of tables
- List of acronyms
- Bibliography
- ...

Structure:
- thesis.tex  --> Contains the Cover page and all settings for the whole thesis
- images/     --> Contains all used images. Name must be unique
- output/     --> Contains the created files from Makefile
- text/       --> Contains the text of your thesis. It is recommend to use for every chapter a new file
- examples/   --> Some basics examples
- Makefile

The examples directory contains my full Bachelorthesis. Everthing is free to use so don't be shy to copy stuff and knowledge.


Getting started:
Note: Linux only; Tested on Ubuntu 16.04 xenial

~$  git clone ...
~$  cd bachelor_project/
~$  cd thesis/
~$  make
In folder output/ are the created files with the pdf-file. The pdf-file is automatically executed from the Makefile. To disable this remove line 2 in the Makefile.


How to insert text to chapter "Introduction" ?
~/bachelor_project/$  cd text/
~/bachelor_project/$  vi introduction.tex //Create a new file

Insert your text
Save with ":wq" //vi specific

~/bachelor_project/$  cd ../
~/bachelor_project/$  vi thesis.tex

Add "\input{text/introduction}" between \begin - \end{document}

~/bachelor_project/$  make

Have fun
